# CS50 Blockchain Gradebook
#### Video Demo:  <URL https://youtu.be/C4VhrkPBY0M>

#### Description:
This is a web3 decentralized application (Dapp) that allows users to track their progress through the CS50 Blockchain course.
The progress is recorded in the blockchain through a smart contract that represents the checklist of 10 steps and has 3 statuses for each step ("Pending", "Submitted", and "Approved").
The owner of the smart contract (the faculty) is the only one allowed to approve the steps and assign grades. The application allows users to connect their crypto wallets using MetaMask, view their progress, submit steps for approval, and see their grades once approved.
The web part of the application was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript while the Smart Contract was written in Solidity and deployed to Ethereum Sepolia testnet (No real money was spent).

#### Goals:
 - Inspire CS50 staff to:
	- Produce a CS50 Blockchain course:
        - Decentralization is the future and CS50 needs to be at the state-of-the-art at least.
  	- Add blockchain capabilities to the CS50 platform:
        - It is not hard to imagine a future where students can submit their work and receive grades in a decentralized way.
        - I is tecnically feasible and achievable with moderate research, design, and development effort.


#### Benefits:
 - Increased robustnes  and value to the grading system:
	- You can now ensure the person in control of the wallet is:
		- The one submitting.
		- The one receiving the grade.
	- You, as the faculty and owner of the Smart contract, are the only 		one allowed to grade.

- Inmutable, persistent and censorship-resistant results records:  	
	- All the submitted work, the scores, and the actors involved in the educational activities are stored in a blockchain.
	- Opportunity for implementing NFT certificate of completion.

 - Transparency:
    - Students can see their progress and grades in a transparent way.
    - tamper-proof record of all submissions and grades.

 - Decentralization:
    - The application is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by a single entity.
    - This increases the security and reliability of the application.

#### Additional Research:
 - I researched how to use Web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and MetaMask.
 - I learned how to write smart contracts in Solidity and deploy them to the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.
 - I explored how to use Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
 - I took the three Vyper smart contract development courses on cyfrin updraft.
 - I completed several chapters of the alchemy university blockchain developer course.
 - I saw all the lectures of the CS50 Web and completed some projects.

#### Next Steps:
 - Add NFT certificate of completion.
 - Add more interactivity to the web application.
 - Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum mainnet.
 - Integrate with the CS50 platform.
 - Explore other blockchain platforms (e.g., Solana, Polkadot, etc.).
 - Explore other use cases for blockchain in education (e.g., credentialing, micro-credentials, etc.).
